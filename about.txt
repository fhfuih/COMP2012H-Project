Dear players: Welcome to our newly developed non-profit game (as well as COMP 2012H Self-Proposed Project) Puzzle Dragon. We hope you will enjoy playing this game and have a great gaming experience!


---Brief Introduction---
The gameplay of this game is similar to a classic game called P&D, which can be divided into two interconnected parts: a tile-matching puzzle and a monster-collecting RPG. Players can create their teams by choosing from the 10 pet monsters that they own within the game. Then, they will enter dungeons with their team and fight waves of enemy monsters. Solving the tile-matching puzzle determines the damage of their pet monsters' attacks.

In the game, players must move and match colored orbs arranged in a grid. The type of orbs and number of matches determine which of the five pet monsters in the team can attack and how much damage they output. An additional layer of challenge is the acquisition, selection, and improvement of the players' team of pet monsters.


---Artwork Design---
First, we must declare that all the character artwork designs in this game are not original. All the monster imagery in this game comes from the art design of Cygames, Inc.

The monsters in Puzzle Dragon are drawn from many origins. Their designs range from fantasy creatures such as dragons, demons, ogres, and goblins to characters based on deities and other figures of various mythologies around the world. Also included are third-party fictional characters, available for limited periods of time.


---Game Design---
Puzzle Dragon is a game developed with Qt. All the logic, algorithms, and game interface designs in the game are original. The specific game features are not repeated here, leaving the players to explore. If you have any ideas for improving the game content, please contact the developer to give your valuable comments.
